Dynamically adjust weather conditions every raid, from clear skies to intense storms that you choose the chance of occurring. Set a static season right at server start. Say goodbye to the terrible default weather that tarkov has and enjoy a more diverse weather system.

Chosen season is set once per server start because of issues I had with fika. Will look into changing this to have dynamic options in future releases.
